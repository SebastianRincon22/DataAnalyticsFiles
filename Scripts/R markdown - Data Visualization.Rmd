# Analysis Report of the Quakes dataset in R

## by Sebastian Rincon

**Create R code Block**

```{r Code block 1}
data("quakes")
str(quakes)
plot(quakes)

```

```{r code block 2}
hist(quakes$mag)
barplot(quakes$stations)
plot(quakes)
```

**Create a plain code block**

```         
The maximum magnitud of an earthquake is 6.40
The minimum magnitud of an earthquake is 4.00

The maximum magnitud of an earthquake is `r max(quakes$mag)`
The minimum magnitud of an earthquake is `r min(quakes$mag)`
```
